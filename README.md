# AutoApplicationMaintenance
This is a Windows Batch Script that perform application maintenance for a custom application. It stops the apps services, waits a bit for them to stop, then if they are hung due to a slow java process, it would force kill those, then it will make a compressed zip file with all the apps log files, move that file to an archived log folder, then delete all of the temp/cache files for clean up, then finally restart the application services. I set up a task in the Windows Scheduler to run this script to run during the clients off hours so they wouldn't even notice the down time. I did change it a little just to protect the identity of my employer at the time and the clients. But basically this how at my employer all my clients by far had the fewest after-hours support calls and it's just a one time task to setup.
